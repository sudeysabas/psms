  <p>This game is called “Dragon Realm”. The player is on an Island of dragons. The dragons live in different caves
with their treasure. The friendly dragon will share their treasure with you. The other dragon is hungry and
will gobble up the player when they enter the cave. The player is standing in front of two caves, one with a
friendly dragon and the other with a hungry dragon and they must choose between the two caves.Practice running through how the game works step by step as you play it, as we will be looking at the
different stages to designing this game next.When designing a game, it is very helpful to write down everything you would like your game to do before to
start writing the code. A flow chart is useful tool that allows you to see a clear picture of all the possible
actions, options or steps in your game and where they will lead. This section will describe in detail how the
flow chart links to the actions of the game as it progresses.</p>
